  <h3>What Ruby and Rails implementations does it work for?</h3>

  <p>We have a <a href="http://travis-ci.org/#!/kovyrin/db-charmer/builds">continuous
  integration setup</a> for this gem on with Rails 2.2, 2.3, 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2 using a few different
  versions of Ruby.</p>

  <p>At the moment we have the following build matrix:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Rails versions:
        <ul>
          <li>2.3</li>
          <li>3.0</li>
          <li>3.1</li>
          <li>3.2</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Ruby versions:
        <ul>
          <li>1.8.7</li>
          <li>1.9.3 (Rails 3.0+ only)</li>
          <li>2.0.0 (Rails 3.2+ only)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Databases:
        <ul>
          <li>MySQL</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    Current status of the build: <img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/kovyrin/db-charmer.png?branch=master" alt="Build Status"/>
  </p>

  <p>In addition to CI testing, we use this gem in production on <a href="http://www.scribd.com/">Scribd.com</a> (one
  of the largest RoR sites in the world) with Ruby Enterprise Edition and
  Rails 2.2/2.3/3.0, Sinatra and even plain Rack applications.</p>

  <p>Starting with version 1.8.0 we support Rails versions up to 3.2.8. Please note, that Rails 3.2.4 is not
    officially supported. Your code may work on that version, but no bug reports will be accepted about this version.</p>


  <h3>Where can I find a changelog for the latest release?</h3>

  <p>There are two ways of getting a list of changes for any particular version:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You can check out the <a href="https://github.com/kovyrin/db-charmer/blob/master/CHANGES">CHANGES</a> file</li>
    <li>Since all the changes are tagged in git, you can use <code>git log</code> command (or Github’s web interface) to get a list of commits between any two versions:
{% highlight bash %}
git log v1.6.5..v1.6.6 # to get a list of changes between two versions
git log v1.6.5..HEAD   # to get a list of all the changes since v1.6.5
{% endhighlight %}
    </li>
  </ul>
